# Datasets

Dataset with cubes in .ply format (in a zip file).

This is easily used from a Google Colab Python notebook.

The cubes have been generated through scripts in <https://github.com/mrquincle/octave-scripts>.

There are two datasets:

* single_cubes.zip
* cubes.zip

The first zip file contains 3D point clouds of single cubes. The second zip file contains 3D point clouds with multiple cubes, generated through a Dirichlet Process.
